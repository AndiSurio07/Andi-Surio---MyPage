  <h1>About Me</h1>
   <hr>
<p>I began my professional journey in 2015, starting in the BPO  industry. Currently, I am working as a freelance web merchandiser for a retail company in Australia. 

In 9 years of working, I wear different hats, from customer service, Admin logistics, sales support, IT support, recruitment specialist and never thought I will end up doing product administrator job which I didn't expect that I will be good at.
</p>

<p>
With the current freelance job related to product merchandising, 
I started with the company doing full time as customer service , taking inbound calls, inbound chat and email, more of online product inquiry and online order follow-ups.
</p>

<p>
My  previous tech experiences have mainly with small computer repair businesses and retail shops, focusing more on hands-on troubleshooting and face-to-face interactions with customers.

In my free time, I dedicate myself in studying, reading tech blogs, participating in tech forums, and watching YouTube tech channels. This is my way of keeping myself updated on everything about tech.
</p>

<p>
  In 2009, I successfully completed a two-year diploma program in computer technology,
where I gained a comprehensive understanding of various IT concepts and acquired
practical skills. Shortly after completing my course, I had the opportunity to work as an
IT assistant for a government organization in the Philippines. This role allowed me to
apply my knowledge and develop a deeper understanding of IT operations. </p>
<p>In the
following year, I was hired by a small business to work as a desktop/laptop technician
at a computer service center, where I gained valuable hands-on experience in
troubleshooting and resolving technical issues.</p>
<p>
During my initial job search, I encountered many employers who preferred candidates
with a 4-year degree in IT and experience in corporate organizations or large
companies. </p>

<p>This influenced my decision to explore other career paths, and I spent
several years working in customer service support roles in the corporate world.
Although these experiences have provided a solid foundation for my career, my passion
for computer technology has always remained strong, and I am now determined to
return to the technical field.</p
